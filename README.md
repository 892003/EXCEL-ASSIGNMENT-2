1A)   If you find yourself needing to expand or reduce Excel's row widths and column heights, there are several ways to adjust them. The table below shows the minimum, maximum and default sizes for each based on a point scale.
1.	Select the column or columns that you want to change.
2.	On the Home tab, in the Cells group, click Format.

2A) COUNT counts how many cells in a range contain numeric data (numbers). COUNTA counts how many populated cells in a range (i.e. not blank). COUNTBLANK counts how many blank cells in a range. COUNTIF counts how many cells in a range meet a certain condition.
The COUNTIF function needs 2 bits of information - the range of cells you are looking at and what it is that you’re checking for. The criteria is always encapsulated in double quotation marks (“) and is not case sensitive.
3A) The fastest way to find and highlight duplicates in Excel is using conditional formatting. The biggest advantage of this method is that it not only shows dupes in the existing data but automatically checks new data for duplicates right when you enter it in a worksheet.
These techniques work in all versions of Excel 365, Excel 2021, Excel 2019, Excel 2016, Excel 2013, Excel 2010 and lower.
4A) Updating a pivot table is a pain, isn’t it? If you use pivot tables in your work frequently I’m sure you can understand.
The point is every time when you add new data to the source sheet you need to update the source range for the pivot table before you refresh your pivot table. Now just imagine if you add data to your source sheet every day you have to update the source range every day.
And every time changing pivot table range is a mess. Yes, that’s right, the more frequently you add data, the more you need to update the source range.
So the point is you need a method to update the source range automatically when you add new data.
NOTE: Pivot tables are one of the INTERMEDIATE EXCEL SKILLS.

5A)

6A) Use VLOOKUP when you need to find things in a table or a range by row. For example, look up a price of an automotive part by the part number, or find an employee name based on their employee ID.
In its simplest form, the VLOOKUP function says:
=VLOOKUP(What you want to look up, where you want to look for it, the column number in the range containing the value to return, return an Approximate or Exact match – indicated as 1/TRUE, or 0/FALSE).
